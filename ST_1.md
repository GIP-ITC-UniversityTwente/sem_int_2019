In this tutorial you will learn how to create Linked Data representation of a 
simple table using software tools.
The source for conversion is a table in a *.csv format. With the help of GraphDB this CSV-file 
will be converted into Linked Data and stored in GraphDB.

**Comma-separated values (CSV)** is a widespread format for spreadsheets and simple databases.
It uses plain text to store tabular data. Each record consists of one or more fields (columns),
separated by commas. This format is not standardized, but the idea to separate values using an agreed
upon delimiter is very simple. There are many variants including tab-separated values and
space-separated values.

Therefore, first of all, we need a table.

### Step 0: Let's make a table <a name="step0"></a>

Bellow is a simple **CSV** table that lists names of 2 persons together with their age and places of birth.
In **CSV** this looks very simple:

```csv
Name,Age,Place of birth
Neil,2,Enschede
Leela,5,Utrecht
```

You can copy the example from above and paste it in a text file. 
Or just [download it](https://1drv.ms/u/s!Ah2_2X7uyAX5iNhG5jxgU27tPh19Bw)

And this is a rendered version:

| Name | Age | Place of birth |
| ---- | --- | -------------- |
| Neil | 2 | Enschede |
| Leela | 5 | Utrecht |

This data will be converted into RDF using GraphDB in the next step.
 
### Step 1: Upload Data via OntoRefine <a name="step1"></a>

Once the table is created it can be uploaded into GraphDB for transformation into LD and importing.

>GraphDB OntoRefine is a data transformation tool, based on [OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org/) and integrated in the 
GraphDB Workbench. It can be used for converting tabular data into RDF and importing it 
into a GraphDB repository, using simple SPARQL queries and a virtual endpoint. 
The supported formats are TSV, CSV, *SV, XLS, XLSX, JSON, XML, RDF as XML, 
and Google sheet. Using OntoRefine, you can easily filter your data, edit its 
inconsistencies, convert it into RDF, and import it into a repository.
