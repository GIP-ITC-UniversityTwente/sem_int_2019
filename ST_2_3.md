## ~~Reconciliation~~ Linking with SPARQL <a name="#ass1"></a>

In the [step 4 of the Assignment Day 1: Create RDF](ST_1.md#step4)
you used the interface of OntoRefine to reconcile the names of the cities against Wikidata data. 
Such services rely on matching literal values between resources of a particular type (e.g municipality of 
the Netherlands as in the [Assignment Day 1: Create RDF](ST_1.md)).
Same functionality can be achieved with SPARQL.
The query below does exactly the same but with LTB data. 
It tries to match labels of concepts from the LTB data and concepts from DBpedia. 

```SPARQL
PREFIX skos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?sub ?label ?dbcon
{
# these 2 pattern retrieve the label of cvoncepts in the  
 ?sub a skos:Concept .
  ?sub rdfs:label ?label .
  Service <http://dbpedia.org/sparql> {
    ?dbcon a skos:Concept .
    ?dbcon rdfs:label ?label .
  }
}
LIMIT 1000
```
