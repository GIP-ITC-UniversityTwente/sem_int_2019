# Introduction
Tutorials and assignments of this course require installation of some tools to mimic a common architecture of 
Linked Data applications. 

# Tools

## Backend: Triplesore.
Databases built for the storage and retrieval of triples using semantic queries are called triplestores. 
The list of existing implementation is quite impressive and includes about 50 different solutions. 
For tutorial we will install and use **[GraphDB](https://www.ontotext.com/products/graphdb/)**, 
developed by [Ontotext](https://www.ontotext.com/), because it has: 
- a lovely Graphical User Interface
- a support of [geoSPARQL](http://graphdb.ontotext.com/documentation/free/geosparql-support.html)
- a free version
