## Introduction


## Ontologies

The release of the GeoSPARQL standard by OGC in 2012 became a breakthrough achievement that 
brought qualitative and quantitative spatial reasoning to the Web of Data. 
This effort used a combination of well-understood and widely used OGC standards such as Geography Markup Language (GML) 
and well-known text (WKT) literals for representation of geospatial data. The OGC’s Simple Features, 
Egenhofer’s 9-intersection model, and RCC8 were used as topological relationship vocabularies and ontologies 
for qualitative reasoning.
