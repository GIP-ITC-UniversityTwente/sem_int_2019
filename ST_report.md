In this tutorial you will build you own data story. 
Since Linked Data is a relatively new technology for most users, many of them are
unaware of the potential that can be unlocked. To bridge the gap between (a) the
vast but implicit potential that a Linked Dataset encapsulates, and (b) the specific
and often more explicit use cases a prototypical user may have in mind, a concept
of Data Stories was introduced and developed by 
[Folmer and Beek (2017)](https://scholarworks.umass.edu/foss4g/vol17/iss1/23/). A Data
Story allows a specific use case to be explained to a potential user through a
sequence of data examples, that are connected by an overarching story. To be as
generic as possible, the data examples that compose a Data Story are
visualizations of SPARQL result sets. This ensures that the components of a Data
Story are declarative (how the data is obtained is encoded in the SPARQL query),
reproducible (the query is recomputed when the Data Story is generated), and
modifiable (advanced users can click a button to open the SPARQL query view,
where the query can be altered and rerun).

Explain steps taken to create the query.
